# EE474_Project
18SP at University of Washington
This is totally new LAB of Professor Peckol's EE474.
It is challenging comparing with other EE474 of UWECE
The lab report is useless and way too long
But the lab is fantastic. You can write a true large Application(E-Doctor) and a Real-Time OS with remote control using Putty to support it!
